      in my portfolio. Most of the projects consist in CMSs that powers content in a 
      SPA website. I used UOL Host(A brazilian hosting provider), Heroku and Red Had Openshift 
      for hosting the web apps. I'm actually migrating all of them to Heroku. 2016 was the year
      I decided to drop the Microsoft stack and go full open source, leaving Windows for Linux.`,
